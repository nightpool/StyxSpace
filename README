StyxSpace is a plugin that allows generation of worlds that are "space", empty.
Authors: iffa, Canis85 (planets), BR (breathable areas), Nightgunner5 (some glowstone populator work)

This branch aims to make StyxSpace compatible with MV2, so I am taking out all of the world management stuff and just leaving the world gen stuff.

NOTE: Latest developer build can be found from target/
