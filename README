StyxSpace is a plugin that allows generation of worlds that are "space", empty. Say you want to make a space station and some planets, you can do so with StyxSpace. We offer you space to build in, you make space really look like space. Freebuild servers (like Styx Reborn!) can use StyxSpace to give their players a world they can freely wander around and build amazing space related builds. Survival servers can use StyxSpace to give players a new world to explore.
